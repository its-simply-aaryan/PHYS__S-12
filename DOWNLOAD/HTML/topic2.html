              <p>Today's lecture started off as the usual website review. I saw some fascinating and creative designs made by other students. This activity was suceeded by unpacking of the kits sent to us. I unfortunately have not received my kit yet, but I tried to follow as much of the instructions I  could  in class and store them in my head. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oOkFU6QEcLgvfiy9Vk4253hDgYmkfd4hihdjB9ccpeg/edit#gid=0">Here</a> is a link to the spreadsheet with the kit components mentioned. The kit consisted of 8 bags of components. Professor Hart showed us most of the bags but we did  not specifically use all of them. We began by a very simple measuring instrument - the vernier calliper. This model was a digital one, as opposed to the metallic manual one I am used to operating. This calliper just makes measuring things more easy and accurate. It runs on a lithium core button cell. Victoria also mentioned a handy safety precaution while using a knife. We ended up measuring the diameter of a screw and the diameter of a smooth bearing after eliminating the zero error from the vernier calliper.

              INTRODUCTION TO LASER CUTTING & ENGRAVING<br/><br/>

              What I've learnt from this class is that a laser cutter is basically an instrument used to cut materials with the help of laser and optical equippment by the passage of a high power volatge. I have also learnt that the speed of the laser cutter can be altered by the amount of power supplied, but we must draw a line somewhere with reference to the material used because excess power may start a fire. <a href="http://tinkertech.io/laser-cutter-materials-guide/">Here</a> is a list of materials that can be used for a laser cutter. Even though this istrument can be used to cut absoulutely anything, we must never cut PVC plastic and ABS Plastic. I've also learnt about the kerf that must be calculated while making the vector lines to cover up for the additional material used up during laser cutting. This is done in order to mould the perfect fit. We did not discuss much about the technicalities of the engraving process but the method is not much different from that of cutting. The only difference is the machine does not cut deep through the entire material but just engraves a picture on top.

              INTRODUCTION TO VINYL CUTTERS, INKSCAPE & GIMP<br/><br/>
               
              For this lecture, we saw more examples then diving into the technicalities. We saw live examples of vinyl cut products and also saw examples of  Vinyl stickers. What I have learnt is that a vinyl cutter is a computer controlled device that is used to cut shapes and ppatterns over a thin self-adhesive plastic.     <a href="https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Tools/2D_design/Inkscape/index.html">Inkscape & Gimp</a> are softwares, the former being an open source vector graphics software and the latter being an open source image processing  program. Both of these are used to develop files that are input into the vinyl cutter.

                <div class="note"style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
                    
                    <p>This week's readings mainly circled around electricity. 3 questions were adressed: <br/>
                      <i><a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity">What is electricity?</a></i><br/><br/>
                      Most of this part of the reading was a revision for what I learnt in the first semester of my senior  year. Yet, it was useful as I plan to work with circuits for my final project.<br/><br/>
                      <i><a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-a-circuit">What is a circuit?</a></i><br/><br/>
                      I left reading one with aq question in my mind and <i>'voila'</i>, reading 2 adresses the very same question. <b>Circuits 101</b> is a tutorial that explains voltage in great  detail. Along  with explanation of various components of a circuit, it also  gave precautions and tips here and there. I think this reading will be very useful for me while making my final project with direct applications of what I've read.<br/><br/>
                      <i><a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/electric-power">Electric Power</a></i><br/><br/>
                    With the help of this tutorial,  I learnt how to calculate power using volatge, current and resistance along with maximum power ratings.</p>

              INTRODUCTION TO AUTODESK FUSION 360<br/><br/>

              I began by downloading the <b>Autodesk Fusion 360</b> software. The downloading process was not difficult and I got a student's liscence for free. My software was not opening at the beginning but it worked after I rebooted my computer system.  I began by experimenting with Fusion: Very archetypal of me to jump right into it; but there were layers I could not resolve. Therefore, I started with the tutorial on the course website which helped me get familiar with Fusion tools. The first tutorial helped me sketch in 2D, extrude surfaces and export DXF files. Post this, I worked with the example that was demonstrated in class.
              <br/><br/>
               
              WEEKLY ASSIGNMENT<br/><br/>
               
              Our assignment for the week was to work through a fusion 360 tutorial and document our learning. The following are the video tutorials I used along with my learning from each of these tutorials.
              <br/><br/> 

             

            <iframe width="700" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vVFYrBClkPc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
              
                <br/><br/>
                This tutorial helped me change the standard units for all constructions, sketching different kinds of objects and more importantly using siple tools such as - trim, mirror, tanget and dimensions.
               <br/><br/>

               After this, I used the <a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/AP-GET-STARTED-OVERVIEW">video lessons</a> provided by Autodesk to explore Fusion 360 further. These lessons were divided into 16 short video lessons. <br/>
               The first video was a brief overview of the capabilities of Fusion 360 - including design, prototyping, animations, renderings and all possibilities along with it.

               <br/><br/>

              The second part of our assignment was to select atleast three components from the kit, measure them using callipers and model them in Fusion 360. We were to create an assembly of these components and document our work on this webpage. I unfortunately have not received my kit yet, which is why I have not modelled the components but I will have it done as soon as I receive my  kit.
