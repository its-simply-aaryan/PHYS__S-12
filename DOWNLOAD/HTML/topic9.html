              LECTURE<br/><br/>

              After the assignment review, today's lecture focussed on wireless communication whcih was super exciting. However ironic, we started the lecture with wired digital communication and learning all about it. Things started getting interesting when we came to ESP32. I had not used the Huzzah Board before so it took me a while to figure out how it worked, but once I did, there was no looking back.
              <br/><br/>
               
              LAN SERVER<br/><br/>
               
Working my way around the LAN server proved to be more challenging than I had expected it to be. I kept getting question marks on my serial monitor. I ended up wasting a lot of time on this and then Victoria suggested me to change my Baud speed on the serial monitor. After doing so, it finally worked. I got my IP Address, and I tried to turn my LED on and off. It didn't work. I was foxd. I played around with my circuit a bit and noticed that one of the ground wiring was chipped. I replaced the wire and the LED(just in case). It worked at last. I was able to use my LAN server to control my LED.              <br/><br/>

              FIREBASE
<br/><br/>
Compared to the LAN server, working my way around firebase was comparatively more comfortable. When I followed the tutorial and set up an LED to pin 5, I figured that my LED was not in synch with my Firebase. After a lot of thinking, I realized that I had made two errors:<br/>
<ol>
  <li>I did not  change to the Real Time Database</li>
  <li>I did not change the Read and Write Statements in the Database to true from false</li>
</ol>
<br/><br/>
After correcting these errors, my LED worked perfectly well  with my Firebase. <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/09_networking/huzzah1b.html">Here</a> is a link to the Firebase tutorial page. <br/>
After this, I tried to get my Firebase to work with a website, which is obviously a more comfortable UI. However, somehow my Firebase did not work through my website. I' still trying to figure out what went wrong.

               <br/><br/>

               APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES
               (APIs)<br/><br/>
               Since my final project is going to be a SMART Alarm clock, I used my time to somehow make my API's work. Of course, I was still trying to come up with a way to control my lcd screen with the huzzah board however I figured I could finish all my backend work before hand. So I went to my Google Database and I generated a Client id for my alarm clcok. After that, I went to Temboo and followed the instruction manual to set up my Google Clander API. Thankfully, that worked well although it took me a while to figure out the generation of client id. 
              <br/> After that, I was setting up my Gmail through Temboo. Turned out, we had to configure Gmail's two step verfication in order to connect it with Temboo's services. I did so and after two hours of working, my API was all set up.

                    <p>This week we had to read <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/capacitors/all">Sparkfun's Introduction to Capacitors</a>. A capacitor is a two-terminal, electrical component. Along with resistors and inductors, they are one of the most fundamental passive components we use. This tutorial explained everything from scratch - how they are made, how they work, units of capacitance, the types of capacitors, etc, etc.It was an interesting read that made me realize that almost all circuits have capacitors.</p>
