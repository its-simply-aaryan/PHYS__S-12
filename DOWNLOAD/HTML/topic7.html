              SENSORS<br/><br/>

              Today's lecture started off with our assignment review. It was actually pretty interesting to see the different 3D scanned objects people had come up with. However, today  was all about sensors and I was super excited about it - particularly because I've always heard people talking about sensors but I've never actually used them myself. <br/>
              <a href="https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Sensors/Sensors.html">Here</a> is a link to the page on Sensors. This page was particularly helpful because it taught me exactly how to configure my Arduino to communicate with each type of sensor. I was overwhelmed with the endless possibilities with a sensor. Professor Hart along with Nathan then introduced us to some specific sensors whhile demonstrating it. 
              <br/><br/>
               
              APPLICATIONS & CALLIBRATIONS<br/><br/>
               This was a very short discussion on what we could do with sensors and how we could apply them in our projects. This paved the way for our assignments for this week which was to fabricate our own sensor to control an output device.

              AUTODESK FUSION 360ASSIGNMENT <br/><br/>
I ended up doing 3 small experiments with this assignment: Two of which involved copper tape and the touch sensor and one of them involved IR LED AND IR Sensor. <br/>
EXPERIMENT 1:<br/>
In this experiment, I planned on measuring proximity of an object using an IR Sensor. I looked up the resources Rob handed out and found how to wire the circuit for proximity sensor. However, due  to some reason my IR sensor gave only two values repeatedly. I tried fiddling with this a lot but it would not budge.<br/>

EXPERIMENT 2:<br/>
In this experiment, i decided to use a copper tape to produce buzzer tones. Since I received my kit late, I had the advantage and I had already learnt output devices so I thought of including it in this assignment. I ran two programs successfully: One was to produce a sound whenever the copper tape was touched, even slighttly: Not to mention this could be applied to covid protection wearable devices. The second prgram I ran kept buzzing when the copper tape was not touched. It was fun to play around with these sensors.<br/>
EXPERIMENT 3:<br/>
The last experiment was something I ended up finally making my final project - a capacitative touch sensor for my lie-detector. All documentation regarding this can be found on my final project page but the following videos will give you an idea of what I meant:<br/><br/>
