                <p>“Machine” for transformative fabrication using the same materials. <br>The same 
“Machine” could be used to put viable designs and structures to test by exposing it to artificially created atmospheric conditions and exposing it to artificial natural disasters

<h1>PROJECT 'Cleaning Bot'</h1> 

 <div class="two-column">
                <p>This project is for the creation of a vaccum cleaning bot that is controlled through an app on your phone. A sensor would help it avoid collisions and estimate jumps such as in case of stairs. Responses would be voice-controlled. The bot would ideally be for two purposes - dry vaccum and mopping the floor.
                  <br><br>
                  The same bot could be used as a transportation instrument. The map or floor plan of the location can be fed  into the system. With a command, the bot would just got to that location. It makes it easier, let's say to send food from the kitchen to the dining room.

                    <h1>Week 1: Docmunetation Note</h1>
                    <p>This week, we were given a set of tasks that proved to be a little challenging as I had no prior experience in coding. The tutorials by <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> helped me find my way around it. This is the website I created to document my progress throughout the course. I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make this website. Above are my proposals for  my final project  for the semester.</p>

                    <p>Our first assignment for the week was to read the first three chapters of <a href="http://mars1980.github.io/resources/making_things_move.pdf"><i>Making Things Move</i></a>. We were also supposed to take notes of some interesting points we learnt. <br/><br/> The first chapter was like a recap for everything I  had learnt during my sophomore year except the part about the gears, whcih was something new and fascinating for me. On reading about the minimum constraints design, I understood how factors are considered before implementing any design. In particular, I was fascinated by Rube Goldberg's breakfast machine project. <br/> Chapter 2 was more of an essential because it talks about a challenge every maker faces - picking the right materials and using them the  right way. I think it was fascinating to read about how alloys have different naming schemes and how materials play such an important role in making different kinds of diving boards. <br/> Chapter 3 was specifically very useful for me as I did not know the uses of scres, nuts and bolts to such a great extent. I think this knowledge will be imperative for me while compiling my final project.</p>
