		            <p>This project would incorporate building a drone that could be used to test potential patients for COVID-19. The very same could also be used for distribution of vaccines when ready at a later stage. <br/><br/></p>

                          <h1>PROJECT 'Test Run'</h1>	

                            <div class="two-column">
                <p>“Machine” for transformative fabrication using the same materials. <br>The same 
“Machine” could be used to put viable designs and structures to test by exposing it to artificially created atmospheric conditions and exposing it to artificial natural disasters
 <br/><br/></p>
              </div>  

<h1>PROJECT 'Cleaning Bot'</h1> 

 <div class="two-column">
                <p>This project is for the creation of a vaccum cleaning bot that is controlled through an app on your phone. A sensor would help it avoid collisions and estimate jumps such as in case of stairs. Responses would be voice-controlled. The bot would ideally be for two purposes - dry vaccum and mopping the floor.
                  <br><br>
                  The same bot could be used as a transportation instrument. The map or floor plan of the location can be fed  into the system. With a command, the bot would just got to that location. It makes it easier, let's say to send food from the kitchen to the dining room.
 <br/><br/></p>

<h1>PROJECT 'KeepTab'</h1>

<div class="two-column">
  <p>This project has varied applications and can be used from a busy college student to a middle aged worker to an old person suffering from memory problems. Project 'KeepTab' is like a personalized Assistant in the form of a wearable device. It could be made voice controlled or phone / gesture controlled and it would rely only on your phone and the wearable object. It will help you set alarms, reminders and much more. Its responses will be voice automated. With the help of a tracking device, it will also help keep track of every object you pick up - leave at a certain place. This will help you recall where you left your car keys or where you left your assignment papers. The modern day carelessness and busy lifestyle can be solved with the help of this device.<br/><br/> </p>

                    <p>This week, we were given a set of tasks that proved to be a little challenging as I had no prior experience in coding. The tutorials by <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> helped me find my way around it. This is the website I created to document my progress throughout the course. I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make this website. Above are my proposals for  my final project  for the semester.</p>

                    <p class="note">Our first assignment for the week was to read the first three chapters of <a href="http://mars1980.github.io/resources/making_things_move.pdf"><i>Making Things Move</i></a>. We were also supposed to take notes of some interesting points we learnt. <br/><br/> The first chapter was like a recap for everything I  had learnt during my sophomore year except the part about the gears, whcih was something new and fascinating for me. On reading about the minimum constraints design, I understood how factors are considered before implementing any design. In particular, I was fascinated by Rube Goldberg's breakfast machine project. <br/> Chapter 2 was more of an essential because it talks about a challenge every maker faces - picking the right materials and using them the  right way. I think it was fascinating to read about how alloys have different naming schemes and how materials play such an important role in making different kinds of diving boards. <br/> Chapter 3 was specifically very useful for me as I did not know the uses of scres, nuts and bolts to such a great extent. I think this knowledge will be imperative for me while compiling my final project.</p>
