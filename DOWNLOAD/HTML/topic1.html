            <P>Given below are my final project  proposals. I would like to mention a bit about my inspiration for all of these. To be very honest,  I have always been an inquisitive explorer and an ambitious person. My projects are always too ambitious to accomplish, something you might see as well after reading my project proposals. This comined with my insatiability makes it difficult for me to put up a satisfactory project. Right now, I am most inclined towards doing Project 'Cleaning Bot', inspired from seeing my mother having  to clean the whole house by herself, with the added fact that it;s the most viable with the given resources but to be honest, my heart mostly responds to Project 'KeepTab' and Project 'Plants Speak', but I have no clue how to go about any of these.</P>
  </div>

          <h1>PROJECT 'Search Party'</h1>
          
                    
	          

		          <div class="two-column">
		            <p>This project would incorporate building a drone that could be used to test potential patients for COVID-19. The very same could also be used for distribution of vaccines when ready at a later stage. <br/><br/></p>
		          </div>   
                 	
                          <h1>PROJECT 'Test Run'</h1>	

                            <div class="two-column">
                <p>“Machine” for transformative fabrication using the same materials. <br>The same 
“Machine” could be used to put viable designs and structures to test by exposing it to artificially created atmospheric conditions and exposing it to artificial natural disasters
 <br/><br/></p>
              </div>  

<h1>PROJECT 'Cleaning Bot'</h1> 

 <div class="two-column">
                <p>This project is for the creation of a vaccum cleaning bot that is controlled through an app on your phone. A sensor would help it avoid collisions and estimate jumps such as in case of stairs. Responses would be voice-controlled. The bot would ideally be for two purposes - dry vaccum and mopping the floor.
                  <br><br>
                  The same bot could be used as a transportation instrument. The map or floor plan of the location can be fed  into the system. With a command, the bot would just got to that location. It makes it easier, let's say to send food from the kitchen to the dining room.
                  <br/>After further consideration, I've decieded to narrow the scope of my project. The transportation part is off the table. I could maybe incorporate this outside of class when I get time. For now, I would focus on the main purpose- dry vaccum and wet mopping. I have rough designs ready for both of these seperately, each design being significantly different from the other but what I'm essentially trying to do now is incorporate both these functionalities into one model. As of now, the design I  have in mind is battery operated anr is to be manually turned on with the help of a switch, but I plan on making  it a chargaable model with bluetooth acess, if possible.
 <br/><br/></p>

<h1>PROJECT 'KeepTab'</h1>

<div class="two-column">
  <p>This project has varied applications and can be used from a busy college student to a middle aged worker to an old person suffering from memory problems. Project 'KeepTab' is like a personalized Assistant in the form of a wearable device. It could be made voice controlled or phone / gesture controlled and it would rely only on your phone and the wearable object. It will help you set alarms, reminders and much more. Its responses will be voice automated. With the help of a tracking device, it will also help keep track of every object you pick up - leave at a certain place. This will help you recall where you left your car keys or where you left your assignment papers. The modern day carelessness and busy lifestyle can be solved with the help of this device.<br/> This project was really close to me, considering that the inspiration for this came from my busy schedule and my habit to procrastinate and forget things.
    <br/>To make it more viable, I have narrowed down the scope to something very simple - reminders and alarms. This would be a Smart Alarm and I would not have to manually set any alarm, ever. It would be connected to my Google calander and a few other apps. All meeting timings mentioned would be automatically set as an alarm. I plan on adding more features to this along the way. I found this video on YouTube and it helped me get a rough idea of how I want this project to be.<br/><br/>

<h1>PROJECT 'Writing Made Easy'</h1>
<div class="two-column">
  <p>This idea is about a device that transcribes everything I speak into written notes. I am a writer and I tend to write long essays which can be painful to write manually. I am also a social entrepreneur and I have to attend hectic meetings. This device will basically write everything I speak, with commands for formatting such as switching paragraphs, headings and much more.<br/><br/></p>
</div>

<h1>PROJECT 'PLANTS SPEAK'</h1>
<div class="two-column">
  <p>With our busy  lives, we often tend to not pay attention to plants around is. This project is about creating adevice that measures the pH of the soil, water content and sensitivity to sunlight. It blares an alarm whenever something goes wrong and a notification pops up in all devices connected with reports and the exact modifications required to bring stability. <br/><br/></p>

                    <p>This week, we were given a set of tasks that proved to be a little challenging as I had no prior experience in coding. The tutorials by <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> helped me find my way around it. This is the website I created to document my progress throughout the course. I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make this website. U used a text editor called <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a> to do my coding on. It made it easy for me to connect this to my Github, commit my changes to the repositary and push them to GitHub Pages. Above are my proposals for  my final project  for the semester.</p>

                    <p class="note">Our first assignment for the week was to read the first three chapters of <a href="http://mars1980.github.io/resources/making_things_move.pdf"><i>Making Things Move</i></a>. We were also supposed to take notes of some interesting points we learnt. <br/><br/> The first chapter was like a recap for everything I  had learnt during my sophomore year except the part about the gears, whcih was something new and fascinating for me. On reading about the minimum constraints design, I understood how factors are considered before implementing any design. In particular, I was fascinated by Rube Goldberg's breakfast machine project. <br/> Chapter 2 was more of an essential because it talks about a challenge every maker faces - picking the right materials and using them the  right way. I think it was fascinating to read about how alloys have different naming schemes and how materials play such an important role in making different kinds of diving boards. <br/> Chapter 3 was specifically very useful for me as I did not know the uses of scres, nuts and bolts to such a great extent. I think this knowledge will be imperative for me while compiling my final project. I would suggest all those who like to build things and are interested in engineering to read this book.</p>
