              As usual, today's class also began with our rituilistic website review following which we spent about  15-20 minutes reviewing topics from last class i.e. Introduction to Microcontrollers, Digital Pins, Analog Input Pins, PWM and Memory.<br/><br/>

                  Today's lecture was very programming focussed. We learnt about Arduino basics - what each term in the code means. We also learnt about various functions, constants and variables including the different data types. This seemed really interesting to me. I will most probably continue to explore and experiment with Arduino even after this course gets over. <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/04_rap_prototyping/foundations"> Here </a>is a link to the page on Arduino foundations.<br/><br/>
                  DOCUMENTING CODES<br/><br/>
                  This was something very simple, yet useful for the entire course.<a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/04_rap_prototyping/documentation"> Here</a> is a link to the guide on efficient code documentation. However, I went ahead with the traditional method of documenting code. On my Arduino IDE, I exported my code as HTML and pasted that onto my text editor.<br/><br/>
                  USING THE L9110 H BRIDGE POWER DRIVER TO DRIVE A MOTOR<br/><br/>
                  This workshop was very intuitive and fairly simple for me. After connecting the GND. and VCC pin of the motor driver to GND. and 5V pin of the MetroBoard, I connected the driver input pins to my microcontroller digital output pins. I ran my code to run the motor and it worked perfectly. I also managed to run the motor at different speeds. Here is the outcome of my result:

              <h1>Readings & Documentation</h1>

                <div class="note"style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
                    
                    <p>This week we were given 3 readings to complete:<br/>
                      Reading 1: <a href="https://bastiaanvanhengel.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/arduino_projects_book.pdf">Arduino Projects Book</a><br/>
                      This was probably one of my favourite readings till now in this course. This book focussed on the very basics of Arduino and various projects we could make with it. Although we were only supposed to read chapters 1 through 3, I ended up going way beyond. <br/>
                      Reading 2: <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law">Voltage, Current, Resistance and Ohm's Law</a><br/>
                      This reading practically summed up my Physics coursework during my Sophomore year so it was more of a recap for me than new learning. However, I ended up exploring the same  concepts on interactive platforms like TinkerCAD and it changed my entire way of thinking about circuits. I had a lot of fun.<br/>
                      Reading 3: <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-vs-digital">Analog vs. Digital Pins</a><br/>
                      This reading helped me understand the difference between Analog signals and Digital Signals. I came to the knowledge that most Arduino projects involved working with both Analog and Digital Pins, which made more sense when I started working on this week's assignment.

              INTRODUCTION TO AUTODESK FUSION 360<br/><br/>

              I began by downloading the <b>Autodesk Fusion 360</b> software. The downloading process was not difficult and I got a student's liscence for free. My software was not opening at the beginning but it worked after I rebooted my computer system.  I began by experimenting with Fusion: Very archetypal of me to jump right into it; but there were layers I could not resolve. Therefore, I started with the tutorial on the course website which helped me get familiar with Fusion tools. The first tutorial helped me sketch in 2D, extrude surfaces and export DXF files.
              <br/><br/>
               
              WEEKLY ASSIGNMENT<br/><br/>
               
              Our assignment for the week was to work through a fusion 360 tutorial and document our learning. The following are the video tutorials I used along with my learning from each of these tutorials.
              <br/><br/>

                <br/><br/>
                This tutorial helped me change the standard units for all constructions, sketching different kinds of objects and more importantly using siple tools such as - trim, mirror, tanget and dimensions.
               <br/><br/>

               After this, I used the <a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/AP-GET-STARTED-OVERVIEW">video lessons</a> provided by Autodesk to explore Fusion 360 further. These lessons were divided into 16 short video lessons. <br/>
               The first video was a brief overview of the capabilities of Fusion 360 - including design, prototyping, animations, renderings and all possibilities along with it.

               <br/><br/>

              The second part of our assignment was to select atleast three components from the kit, measure them using callipers and model them in Fusion 360. We were to create an assembly of these components and document our work on this webpage. I unfortunately have not received my kit yet, which is why I have not modelled the components but I will have it done as soon as I receive my  kit.
